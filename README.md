## Notes

- One of the main challenges was setting the constraints and getting the view to work in both vertical and horizontal orientation. At first, I tried a different approach and realized it was too difficult, so I started from scratch multiple times and played around with it. However, if there's an easier way to do this, I'd love to know!
- Another challenge was setting the app icon. It's self explanatory and videos on Youtube helped, but I couldn't see the icon once I ran the app. I realized it was because I needed to stop the emulator and quit it. Then, once I reopened it again, it appeared. But, I spent a lot of time until I figured out I had to stop and quit it.
